MarketSim is a stock market simulator created using react, express, TypeScript(for the server), and PostgresQL. MarketSim was designed to be mobile-first, but also desktop friendly. The main goal of this project is to allow users to practice making investments without the risk of the real-world stock market. Feel free to make mistakes and try new things, because it's just a simulation.
